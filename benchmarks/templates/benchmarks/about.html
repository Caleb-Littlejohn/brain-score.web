    The goal of the Brain-Score platform is to enable researchers to quickly get a sense of
    how their model scores against standardized brain benchmarks on multiple dimensions,
    as well compare against other models.
    At the same time, new brain data can quickly be compared against a wide range of models
    to determine how well existing models explain the data.

<p>
    Brain-Score is organized by the <a href="http://dicarlolab.mit.edu">DiCarlo lab @ MIT</a>
    in collaboration with other labs worldwide.
    We are working towards making this into an easy-to-use platform where
    a model can easily be submitted to yield its scores on a range of brain benchmarks and
    new benchmarks can be incorporated to challenge the models.

    This quantified approach lets us keep track of how close our models are to the brain
    on a range of experiments (data) using different evaluation techniques (metrics).
