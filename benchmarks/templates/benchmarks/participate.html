<h4>Challenge the data: Score a model</h4>
There are two ways to score a model on Brain-Score:
<ol>
    <li>clone the <a href="">GitHub repository</a> and follow the steps described there to evaluate the model locally</li>
    <li>{{ contact }} to hand us your model (we are working on automating this step)</li>
</ol>

<h4>Challenge the models: Submit a benchmark</h4>
If you have neural or behavioral recordings that you would like models to compete on, {{ contact }}.
