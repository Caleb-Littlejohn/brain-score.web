    <h4>Challenge the data: Score a model</h4>
    There are two ways to score a model on Brain-Score:
    <ol>
        <li>clone the {{ models_github }} and follow the steps described there to evaluate the model
            locally
        </li>
        <li>{{ contact }} to hand us your model (we are working on automating this step)</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Challenge the models: Submit a benchmark</h4>
    If you have neural or behavioral recordings that you would like models to compete on, {{ contact }}.

    <h4>Change the evaluation: Submit a metric</h4>
    If you have an idea for a different way of comparing brain and machine,
    either fork the {{ brain_github }} to implement your metric and submit a pull request to us,
    or {{ contact }}.
